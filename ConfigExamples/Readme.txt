Config file examples
====================

config.src.example
------------------
You have to
- create your own ../config.src (note the changed file ending);
- change variables there in 'Mandatory' section.
Without ../config.src ../Makefile does not work.


Apache examples for different OS'es
-----------------------------------
Linux : see Apache_Linux/Readme.txt
OS X  : see Apache_OS_X/Readme.txt

Note: mapping from *.php5 file suffix to PHP5 isn't needed for RYT, because
there are only *.php suffixes and PHP5 is assumed as server default.
