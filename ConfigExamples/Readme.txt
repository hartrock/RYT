Config file examples
====================

config.src.example
------------------
You have to
- create your own ../config.src (note the changed file ending);
- change variables there in 'Mandatory' section.
Without ../config.src ../Makefile does not work.


Apache examples for different OS'es
-----------------------------------
Note: Apache configuration for interpreting *.php5 file endings with PHP5 has been needed for using an external server, which interprets *.php files with a lower PHP version.

Linux : see Apache_Linux/Readme.txt
OS X  : see Apache_OS_X/Readme.txt
