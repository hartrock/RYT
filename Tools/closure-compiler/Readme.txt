Guys, someone here found an alternative (jar lib) to yuicompressor with ES6 support?

As far as I have researched, I believe yuicompressor is a pretty old library which is not being maintained anymore and hence it does not cater to ES6 and the newer syntaxes.

So even last yuicompressor version v2.4.8 shouldn't work:
