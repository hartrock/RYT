 * Changes by Stephan Rudlof <sr>:
 * - line spacing,
 * - rounding coordinates,
 * - [fix] callback logic for animation: seems not to be a browser issue (at least it's in 3 different then...),
 *   but in spite of this I haven't found an error in Raphael code....
 *   -> fix uses hardwired callback not installed by setTimeout(), but called directly after elem has been
 *      removed from animationElements.

*       [sr][patch] uppercase 'X' instead of 'x' as close symbol: seems to be better than changing font size in css.
*       [sr][patch] new option appendOrPrepend: 'prepend' inserts a notice at the beginning
*       [sr][patch] return notice item inner for being able to manipulate it afterwards
*       [sr][patch] use width instead of height for notice collapse animation
