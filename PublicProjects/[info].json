have successfully started http://www.evolgo.de/RYT/app.html'RYT' (Roll Your Tasks).\n\nThere are screencasts showing first steps with RYT: http://www.evolgo.de/RYT_Screencast/MaryNPeterConflictResolution_1.mov'screencast 1' , http://www.evolgo.de/RYT_Screencast/MaryNPeterConflictResolution_2.mov'screencast 2' and http://www.evolgo.de/RYT_Screencast/MaryNPeterConflictResolution_3.mov'screencast 3' .\n\nWhat you see here is the content of a @@@<span style=\"color:yellow;\">comment</span>@@@ element:\n- it will be shown rendered by\n  - giving its id as an URL parameter (opens window automatically), and\n  - by hovering over it at canvas;\n- it can be edited by double-clicking it at canvas.\n\nHints for a fast start\n======================\n- Just play around with RYT to get a feeling for it!\n  You could\n  - move @@@<span style=\"color:green;\">task</span>@@@ or @@@<span style=\"color:yellow;\">comment</span>@@@ elements around;\n  - connect tasks: click-move at a connector point (bottom-right corner of task) and drag connection to another task;\n  - press the 'new' button for having an empty canvas (for keeping this project open you could use another window);\n  - hover over\n    - an element (task, comment), or\n    - element link (colored text rectangles in info wins)\n    for getting info about it;\n  - double-click canvas\n    -> create @@@<span style=\"color:green;\">task</span>@@@;        \n  - shift-double-click canvas\n    -> create @@@<span style=\"color:yellow;\">comment</span>@@@;\n  - double-click an element\n    -> edit its content;\n  - use undo/redo for navigating backward/forward in time:\n    -> this also opens windows related to changes made.\n\n- After creating a task, you may add subtasks by double-clicking created task element at canvas: this opens a subcanvas as part of the 'Edit Task' dialog...\n- More info is available by\n  - elements in this [info] project,\n  - hovering over buttons (at the top), and\n  - hovering over the '?' button: this gives a help menu.\n\nNote: if you want to play around taking this project as a start, just save it under another name (without [] around): the original one is only changeable by giving an admin password, which you shouldn't have ;-)

snapshots':\n    - condenses activities between snapshot markers, but keeps snapshot markers.\n    ('condense all' removes all of history).\n  - Undo/redo animates creation/deletion of widgets:\n    → so it should be easier to follow changes.\n- There is a new data model Model_v1.2 under the hood:\n  - less storage needed for saving of history;\n  - older data model will be automatically converted to new one.\n\nRYTv1.6.8 (2011-11-24)\n---------\n- [enh] FlowEditor: rectangle select\n  Selection of elements by click-move at canvas.\n\nRYTv1.6.7 (2011-11-24)\n---------\n- [fix][chrome] setting
