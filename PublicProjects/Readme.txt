Located here are public projects being accessed by all endusers of RYT:
- examples,
- documentation ([info]).
They will be installed as part of first install.

If you later change these projects in your RYT installation by saving them modified, you will be asked what to do, if performing a
  make upgrade
after a repository update.
.

Saving a project with brackets around the project name - [thisIsAProject] - ensures the following:
- storage in public area accessible by all endusers;
- that only a RYT admin is able to store/overwrite them (by using set RYT admin password).
