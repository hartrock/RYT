For just installing a current release of RYT as a service, you don't need info from this section.\n\nThere is a clear separation between development files in REPO_DIR and installed RELEASE_DIR versions; REPO_DIR may be elsewhere.\nFor mere installation of the current RYT version this is fine.\n\nBut for development more is better: it is nice to change some devel *.js file or *.php5 script in the repo and see effects by just doing a browser reload.\nTo make this work,\n- devel files in REPO_DIR have to be accessible from the webserver, and\n- RYT_DATA_DIR has to be accessible from devel PHP5 scripts accessing it.\n\nGetting webserver access to devel version located in REPO_DIR (~/RYT/Devel) is easy: just set a link RYT_DIR/REPO_DIRNAME -> REPO_DIR.\nMore difficult is the route from REPO_DIR to RYT_DATA_DIR. Since data accessing scripts use a relative path to RYT_DATA_DIR, REPO_DIR/../../ has to be writable for creating a softlink to RYT_DATA_DIR (~/RYT_Install/RYT_Data) at the place where it is expected from the devel PHP5 script.\n\nTherefrom repo location for this kind of development use is somewhat restricted: e.g. /tmp/REPO_DIR would not work (we don't want to write into /). Two levels below ~ (HOME) is a good place.","lastModificationTime":1330520423038,"modificationCount":14}}},"from":"change"},{"marker":{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330517349678_1_1","creationTime":1330520433145,"createdBy":"sr"},"from":"GUI"},{"marker":{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330517349678_1_2","creationTime":1330522467135,"createdBy":"sr"},"from":"GUI"},{"marker":{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330517349678_1_3","creationTime":1330568435329,"createdBy":"sr"},"from":"GUI"}],"markers":[{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330290330348_1_6","creationTime":1330290407500,"createdBy":"sr"},{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330290433121_1_1","creationTime":1330290625083,"createdBy":"sr"},{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330387564113_1_2","creationTime":1330391451108,"createdBy":"sr"},{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330391469465_1_1","creationTime":1330393577717,"createdBy":"sr"},{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330393592278_1_4","creationTime":1330394635420,"createdBy":"sr"},{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330394641091_1_1","creationTime":1330395279931,"createdBy":"sr"},{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330394641091_1_2","creationTime":1330395978534,"createdBy":"sr"},{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330396069193_1_1","creationTime":1330402086446,"createdBy":"sr"},{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330416684088_1_1","creationTime":1330430228525,"createdBy":"sr"},{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330432667505_1_1","creationTime":1330434707798,"createdBy":"sr"},{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330517349678_1_1","creationTime":1330520433145,"createdBy":"sr"},{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330517349678_1_2","creationTime":1330522467135,"createdBy":"sr"},{"type":"marker","id":"sr_1330517349678_1_3","creationTime":1330568435329,"createdBy":"sr"}]},"versionMajor":1,"versionMinor":2,"users":{"sr":"Stephan Rudlof"},"title":null,"lockedBy":null,"rootID":"init_1330290330348_1_1","copyStoreID":"init_1330290330348_1_2"}
