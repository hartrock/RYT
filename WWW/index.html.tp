    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="app.html" title="click for starting RYT">Roll Your
    Tasks (RYT)</a> (click link for start) is a browser based task management application for
    individuals and small groups.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It runs with JavaScript capable browsers, e.g.
        <ul>
          <li>Firefox (used for development),</li>
          <li>Chrome,</li>
          <li>Safari;</li>
        </ul>
        but it seems to be that Internet Explorer does <em>not</em> work.
      </li>
      <li>Project data will be stored locally and at server for
        <ul>
          <li>sharing projects between different hosts, and</li>
          <li>working offline.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Much more info is available by
        <ul>
          <li>
          taking a look into <a href="#Screenshots">Screenshots</a> above;
          <li>
          <a href="http://www.evolgo.de/RYT_Screencast/MaryNPeterConflictResolution_1.mov">screencast 1</a>,
          <a href="http://www.evolgo.de/RYT_Screencast/MaryNPeterConflictResolution_2.mov">screencast 2</a> and
          <a href="http://www.evolgo.de/RYT_Screencast/MaryNPeterConflictResolution_3.mov">screencast 3</a>,
          which are showing you first steps with RYT; and
          </li>
          <li>
          the <em>[info]</em> project, which should be loaded automatically after first start of RYT.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Unminified Version</h3>
      <p>
        There is an <a href="app_unminified.html" title="click for starting RYT">unminified version</a>, too.
      </p>

    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>Feedback is appreciated. Please use mail via (RYT) <em>?&rarr;Feedback</em> menu. Don't worry: it's an ordinary mailto (no web form).</p>

    <h2>ToDo</h2>
    Remake screencasts and screenshots with current RYT version.

    <h2>About this Service</h2>
    The RYT service here is provided as it is: feel free to use it
    <ul>
      <li>to play around with RYT, and</li>
      <li>for your own projects.</li>
    </ul>
    However, permanent availability cannot be guaranteed. If you want to start your own RYT service, see <a href="#Your_own_RYT_Service">Your own RYT Service</a> below.

    <h3>About 'dangerous' JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
      There has been an article <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">The JavaScript Trap</a> by Richard Stallman (FSF). This has motivated me to also provide an unminified - functional identical - RYT version in addition to the minified default.
    </p>
    <p>
    The minified version once has been made - <em>after</em> the unminified (more developer friendly) one -, because a colleague of mine has had a very slow internet connection in a train... (now it is the default). My suggestion is to use the minified default one.
    </p>
    <h3>Software as a Service (SAAS)</h3>
    The term 'software as a service' (SAAS) is suited for describing some of RYT's features:
    <ul>
      <li>no software installation needed,</li>
      <li>automatic upgrade (reload in browser),</li>
      <li>usable from different computers,</li>
      <li>data in the 'cloud'.</li>
    </ul>
    This functionality is comfortable for the enduser.
    <p>
    FSF sees SAAS as dangerous for the freedom of the individual person. But how to keep enduser comfort while at the same time keeping the user data private?
    </p>
    <h3>There is a partial solution...</h3>
    <p>
    Currently there is an - experimental - feature of <em>encrypting</em> user project data <em>before</em> pushing it onto the server. It remains the problem of not using https for communication with the server. I'm providing RYT at my own server costs (not much so far) and currently don't have such a use case for myself; but installing RYT at a server providing https access should be no problem.

    <h2><a name="Your_own_RYT_Service">Your own RYT Service</a></h2>
    Audience: this section is <em>not</em> for RYT endusers (using it as a service). It is for people, who want to provide their own RYT service.
    <h3><a name="License_and_where_to_get_it">License and where to get it</a></h3>
    <p>
    RYT is open-sourced at
    <a href="https://github.com/hartrock/RYT">Github</a> under the <a href="https://github.com/hartrock/RYT/blob/master/agpl_short.txt">AGPL</a> license (<a href="https://github.com/hartrock/RYT/blob/master/agpl.txt">long version</a>).
    </p>
    <h4>What you can do with it</h4>
    This is how I (Stephan Rudlof) have understood the AGPL license: please contact me, if you want to start your own RYT service and think I'm wrong.
    <ul>
      <li>
      You are free to install RYT at your own server and provide a RYT service on your own (with being paid for it or not). To give your endusers access to the RYT software, a link to <a href="https://github.com/hartrock/RYT">Github</a> or <a href="http://www.evolgo.de/RYT/">this webside</a> should be sufficient.
      </li>
      <li>
      If you extend/fork RYT and provide the extended/forked version as a service (paid or not), you have to give every enduser of your extended/forked RYT version the possibility to get the extended/forked version as software (e.g. by publishing it at Github) under the same <a href="https://github.com/hartrock/RYT/blob/master/agpl_short.txt">AGPL</a> license. The idea here is, that extensions/forks become as free as the original software, too.
      </li>
    </ul>
