    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It runs with JavaScript capable browsers, e.g.
        <ul>
          <li>Firefox (used for development),</li>
          <li>Chrome,</li>
          <li>Safari;</li>
        </ul>
        but it seems to be that Internet Explorer does <em>not</em> work.
      </li>
      <li>Project data will be stored locally and at server for
        <ul>
          <li>sharing projects between different hosts, and</li>
          <li>working offline.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Much more info is available by
        <ul>
          <li>
          taking a look into <a href="#Screenshots">Screenshots</a> above;
          <li>screencasts about

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="SomeFeatures">Some Features</a></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile:
        <ul>
          <li>data storage at server allows accessing
            <ul>
              <li><em>own</em>    projects from different hosts,</li>
              <li><em>shared</em> projects with others you know,</li>
              <li><em>public</em> projects for all;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>using local browser storage allows
            <ul>
              <li>offline mode,</li>
              <li>temporarily having no server connection, and</li>
              <li>personalized user experience.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>GUI:
        <ul>
          <li>responsive: because server interaction is only needed for loading/storing project data from/to there, user interaction with GUI widgets is very fast;</li>
          <li>comfortable (see below).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Arbitrary task nesting: tasks may contain subtasks, which may also contain subtasks, etc..</li>
      <li>Task properties:
        <ul>
          <li>successors/predecessors:
            <ul>
              <li>finishing a task may depend from finishing predecessors, for which it is one of their successors;</li>
              <li>such a relation is made by dragging an arrow from a task to its successor;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>finished state:
            <ul>
              <li>mutliple subtask logics (all have to be finished, one has to be finished, etc.);</li>
              <li>propagates to successors;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>priority:
            <ul>
              <li>propagates to predecessors;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>priority and finished state may be set to 'non-applicable' (which is the default for priority).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Versioning with smart comparison of different versions:<br>
        if there is a 'save' or 'load' interaction (between client and server), it is known
        <ul>
          <li>if they are the same, or</li>
          <li>if the target can be upgraded savely, or</li>
          <li>if there is some conflict needing to ask for a decision from the user.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><a name="GUIFeatures">GUI Features</a></h4>
    <p>
      Looking at screenshots or into screencasts is recommended, but for those preferring text here are some GUI features.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>2-D positioning of elements:
        <ul>
          <li>task and comment elements (widgets) can be placed <em>freely</em> into so called 'flow' canvases (this is possible by using SVG),
          </li>
          <li>this also works for subtasks by using 'flow' canvases for them, too (being part of the task editor widget);
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>fast element creation by clicking at (flow) canvas:
        <ul>
          <li>double-click &rarr; task,</li>
          <li>shift-double-click &rarr; comment;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>fast navigation by hovering (moving mouse over) element widgets, which triggers info windows with rendered element - task, comment - content;
      </li>
      <li>unlimited undo/redo of all element/relation changes (as long as storage isn't exhausted):
        <ul>
          <li>history of element/relation changes can be condensed;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>'tape recorder' widget for undo/redo actions:
        <ul>
          <li>replay of changes forward and backward in time,</li>
          <li>visualization of 'save' actions by 'snapshot markers',</li>
          <li>triggers windows for visualizing changes;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>diff windows:
        <ul>
          <li>showing textual differences between elements,</li>
          <li>automatically triggered by undo/redo actions;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>markup for rendering typed-in text into HTML:
        <ul>
          <li>simple:
            <ul>
              <li>should mostly give what you expect, if you don't know it at all,</li>
              <li>easy to learn, if you want to use it,</li>
              <li>does <em>not</em> try to replace HTML,</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>modest: tries to stay near what you see in the text editor,</li>
          <li>raw text mode: for embedding console output, etc.,</li>
          <li>support for links:
            <ul>
              <li><em>internal</em> for referencing other elements in <em>current</em> project (opening info windows), and</li>
              <li><em>external</em> for referencing things <em>outside</em> current project,</li>
            </ul>
          <li>flexible: if you really want it, you can even embed HTML.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Unminified Version</h3>
      <p>
        There is an <a href="app_unminified.html" title="click for starting RYT">unminified version</a>, too.
      </p>

    <h2>About this Service</h2>
    <p>
    The RYT service here is provided as it is: feel free to use it
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>to play around with RYT, and</li>
      <li>for your own projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    However, permanent availability cannot be guaranteed. If you want to start your own RYT service, see <a href="#Your_own_RYT_Service">Your own RYT Service</a> below.

    <h3>About 'dangerous' JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
      There has been an article <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">The JavaScript Trap</a> by Richard Stallman (FSF). This has motivated me to also provide an unminified - functional identical - RYT version in addition to the minified default.
    </p>
    <p>
    The minified version once has been made - <em>after</em> the unminified (more developer friendly) one -, because a colleague of mine has had a very slow internet connection in a train... (now it is the default). My suggestion is to use the minified default one.
    </p>
    <h3>Software as a Service (SAAS)</h3>
    <p>
    The term 'software as a service' (SAAS) is suited for describing some of RYT's features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>no software installation needed,</li>
      <li>automatic upgrade (reload in browser),</li>
      <li>usable from different computers,</li>
      <li>data in the 'cloud'.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    This functionality is comfortable for the enduser.
    </p>
    <p>
    FSF sees SAAS as dangerous for the freedom of the individual person. But how to keep enduser comfort while at the same time keeping the user data private?
    </p>
    <h3>There is a partial solution...</h3>
    <p>
    Currently there is an - experimental - feature of <em>encrypting</em> user project data <em>before</em> pushing it onto the server. It remains the problem of not using https for communication with the server. I'm providing RYT at my own server costs (not much so far) and currently don't have such a use case for myself; but installing RYT at a server providing https access should be no problem.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="Your_own_RYT_Service">Your own RYT Service</a></h2>
    <p>
    Audience: this section is <em>not</em> for RYT endusers (using it as a service). It is for people, who want to provide their own RYT service.
    </p>
    
    <h3><a name="License_and_where_to_get_it">License and where to get it</a></h3>
    <p>
    RYT is open-sourced at
    <a href="https://github.com/hartrock/RYT">Github</a> under the <a href="https://github.com/hartrock/RYT/blob/master/agpl_short.txt">AGPL</a> license (<a href="https://github.com/hartrock/RYT/blob/master/agpl.txt">long version</a>).
    </p>
    <h4>What you can do with it</h4>
    <p>
    This is how I (Stephan Rudlof) have understood the AGPL license: please contact me, if you want to start your own RYT service and think I'm wrong.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      You are free to install RYT at your own server and provide a RYT service on your own (with being paid for it or not). To give your endusers access to the RYT software, a link to <a href="https://github.com/hartrock/RYT">Github</a> or <a href="http://www.evolgo.de/RYT/">this webside</a> should be sufficient.
      </li>
      <li>
      If you extend/fork RYT and provide the extended/forked version as a service (paid or not), you have to give every enduser of your extended/forked RYT version the possibility to get the extended/forked version as software (e.g. by publishing it at Github) under the same <a href="https://github.com/hartrock/RYT/blob/master/agpl_short.txt">AGPL</a> license. The idea here is, that extensions/forks become as free as the original software, too.
      </li>
    </ul>
